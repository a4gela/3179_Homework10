    <h1>An overview of Australian shark incidents</h1>

    <h2>About the data</h2>
    <p>
        The Australian Shark-Incident Database (ASID), formerly known as the Australian Shark Attack File (ASAF), is a <br>dataset first created by members of the Taronga Conservation Society Australia in 1984. It has since kept an <br>active and uninterrupted record of shark-human interactions, from incidents reporting back from 1791 until now.

        <br><br>

        At present, the Australian Shark-Incident Database (ASID) is maintained by a joint partnership with Taronga <br>Conservation Society Australia, Flinders University, and the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries.
